# Image Scraping Web App with MongoDB Integration

This is a Python web application for scraping images from Google Images and storing them in a MongoDB database. The application is built using the Flask web framework and utilizes the Beautiful Soup library for web scraping.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3
- Flask
- Beautiful Soup (bs4)
- Requests
- pymongo
- MongoDB (you will need to set up a MongoDB database for image storage)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask beautifulsoup4 requests pymongo

1. Make sure you have a MongoDB database set up and adjust the connection details in the code accordingly.

2. Run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python app.py

# Notes
- The application uses a fake user agent to avoid being blocked by Google. However, this is not a guaranteed solution, and Google may still block requests.

- Remember to handle exceptions and errors in the code to ensure robustness.

- This is a basic example of web scraping and image storage. You can extend it by adding more features and error handling as needed.
